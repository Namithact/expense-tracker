A full-featured expense tracking application built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Firebase Hosting**. This app allows users to manage their income and expenses, visualize data, and enjoy a clean, responsive interface. Built as a hands-on learning project to deepen my understanding of modern React architecture and tooling.
